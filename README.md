# arraymaxsum
how to get maximum sum of array.
hi guys,
 This is my first try to github.
 my first repository consists of two programs of array
 the first one gives the maximum sum possible from array elements.
 the other one simply tells the order is zigzag or not.
 if you can optimize the code , You are welcome.
 Thank you.
